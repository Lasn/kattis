# Kattis Library

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a different Kattis problem. Each directory includes the source code for the solution. Test cases for each problem can be found on the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) website.
